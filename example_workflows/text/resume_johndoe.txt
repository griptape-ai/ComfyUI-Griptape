Objective:  
Seeking an over-caffeinated position as a Senior Software Engineer where I can write astonishingly good code, break things occasionally, and push the boundaries of what's possible (and sometimes what's sensible).  

Experience:

Software Engineer Extraordinaire, Tech Corp Inc.  
May 2021 - Present  
- Developed applications in Python that solved problems no one even knew existed.
- Single-handedly reduced load times by 73% (approximately 1 millionth of a second faster!).
- Earned "Bug Whisperer" title for solving an issue that had been plaguing the team since 2018. It was a semicolon.
- Trained 5 interns on the fine art of refactoring code while making them laugh (very important in team morale).

Junior Code Monkey, Web Solutions LLC  
July 2020 - April 2021  
- Assisted with the development of 32.5 websites. That .5 was for a client who couldn’t decide on anything.
- Debugged CSS issues so terrifying, the rest of the team refused to go near them.
- Contributed to weekly "Coding Horror Stories" sessions where my CSS exploits were often featured.

Intern, Always Broken Enterprises  
June 2019 - June 2020  
- Maintained 99.9% uptime by restarting the server daily.
- Created a sophisticated bot named *Botty McBotface* for Slack that only crashed on Fridays.
- Learned that “bug-free code” is an oxymoron, but my coffee addiction is not.

Education:

B.S. in Computer Science, University of Somewhere  
May 2020  
- Minored in “Hitting F5 to Debug.”
- GPA: 3.1415 (approximation, just like the pie).
- Senior project: Developed a mobile app that detects sarcasm in text. Results were… mixed.

Skills:

- **Programming Languages:** Fluent in Python, C++, and Sarcasm.  
- **Web Development:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the ancient dark art of jQuery.  
- **Teamwork:** Known for coordinating with others by extensive use of memes and GIFs.  
- **Leadership:** Managed a rogue team of coffee-charged developers for six hours during a hackathon.  

Projects:

- **WeatherAppButFancy:** A weather app that gives you your forecast, in haiku form.
- **Slackbot 5000:** Custom bot for work to remind people to file their TPS reports and occasionally offer words of wisdom.
- **Bug Detector 3000:** Used machine learning (and a lot of guesswork) to predict the occurrence of bugs before they even happened. Success rate: 20% (but it was funny when it worked).

Hobbies:

- **Competitive Refactoring:** There’s no spaghetti code I can’t untangle (or turn into worse spaghetti).
- **GIF Curation:** Handpicks the perfect GIF for any occasion, especially debugging sessions.
- **Coffee Enthusiast:** Connoisseur of fine coffee and frequent contributor to the "I need coffee" Slack channel.
