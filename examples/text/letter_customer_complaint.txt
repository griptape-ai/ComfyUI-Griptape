Dear QuickFix Customer Service,

I am writing to express my disappointment with a recent purchase from your store. On January 30, I bought a “Zappy Blender Pro” model, which unfortunately stopped working after just one week of use. 

I followed all recommended instructions for use and maintenance, so I was surprised and frustrated by this failure. I returned to the store, only to find that my warranty was not recognized due to a “clerical issue.” I am requesting either a full refund or a replacement for the blender, as I believe this is a reasonable resolution.

I look forward to your prompt response and a satisfactory resolution. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,  
Alex Green
