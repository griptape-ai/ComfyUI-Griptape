Dear Grandma,

I hope you’re doing well! I miss you and all the little things you do to make everyone feel at home. Mom told me you made your famous apple pie last week—I swear I could smell it all the way over here!

Things have been busy here, but I’m enjoying my classes and even joined the gardening club. Who would’ve thought I’d inherit your green thumb? I’ve been growing a little basil plant, though it’s nowhere near as amazing as your backyard garden.

Can’t wait to come visit soon! Give my love to Grandpa, and please save me a slice of that pie if you make it again.

Love,  
Lucy
