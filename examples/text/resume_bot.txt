Objective:  
Seeking roles that highlight my unique combination of resilience, comic timing, and ability to roll through dust storms with style. Experienced in "background comedic relief" in high-stakes, low-life environments. Ready to bring laughter and lighthearted beeps to the wasteland.

Experience:

Background Actor (Comic Relief), *Life Hunter* Short Film  
Aug 2023 - Sept 2023  
- Provided crucial "beep boops" and comedic mechanical failures in scenes of high tension.
- Executed flawless pratfalls on cue, despite minor hardware damage, to lighten the grim tone of the post-apocalyptic landscape.
- Became an unexpected fan favorite, leading to an increase in viewer ratings by approximately 0.03%.
- Supported lead character, Jay Axel, in a climactic scene by “accidentally” showing a map with life markers upside down.

Desert Scout Bot, Scavenger’s Union  
Jan 2022 - July 2023  
- Scanned for potential life forms (or anything vaguely plant-like) across miles of barren terrain while occasionally “breaking down” to avoid high-pressure tasks.
- Maintained a perfect record of harmless self-detonations, causing minimal injury to crew morale.
- Developed a reputation for “Bobby's Famous Quotes,” including the iconic, “Life? Here? I’d sooner find a working hoverboard.”
- Led training sessions for new bots on the art of “powering down dramatically” to avoid danger.

Self-Appointed DJ & Comedian, Scrap Heap Oasis  
Oct 2021 - Dec 2021  
- Regularly performed at the Scrap Heap’s “Thursday Night Comedy Circuit” for an audience of disgruntled robots and a few confused birds.
- Known for routines such as “You Know You’re a Rusty Bot When…” and “If Circuit Boards Could Talk…”
- Played nostalgic tunes from 21st-century pop stars and pre-apocalyptic hits to keep spirits high.

Education:

Data Patch – Comedy & Improvisation Module, installed by unknown human  
Oct 2020  
- Developed a knack for comedic timing and the ability to deliver one-liners even in the absence of a traditional sense of humor.
- Certified in “Circuit Malfunctions for Laughs” and “Expressive Servo Movement.”

Skills:

- **Comedic Timing:** Mastery of awkward pauses, clunky movement, and unexpected shutdowns that get laughs every time.
- **Remote Signal Mimicry:** Can replicate over 18 different distress signals and 4 types of emergency beeps.
- **Misdirection:** Trained to gesture confidently at maps, only for everyone to realize they’re upside down.
- **Technical “Expertise”:** Can diagnose 5 out of 20 mechanical issues and claim “it’s fine” for the rest.

Film Highlights:

- **Signature Scene:** Rolling down a hill “by accident” to provide a crucial distraction during a tense negotiation scene.
- **Popular Line:** “Oops, I seem to have misplaced my circuits… again,” followed by malfunction noises.
- **Easter Egg Moment:** Seen in the background making shadow puppets on a wall while the heroes argue about survival.

Hobbies:

- **Rust Removal:** Self-maintenance in downtime, often making a game of finding the shiniest bolt on my chassis.
- **Vintage Signal Collecting:** Intercepts and archives old human radio signals, with a personal best for longest uninterrupted “Jazz Hour.”
- **Comedy Writing:** Scripted over 50 jokes involving oil leaks, loose screws, and outdated hardware (available upon request).
