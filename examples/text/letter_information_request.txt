Dear Archives Department,

I am a postgraduate student at Scholar University researching historical records from the late 19th century, particularly related to immigration patterns. I understand that the National Library holds collections from this period and am interested in accessing relevant documents, letters, and records.

Could you please provide information regarding the availability of these records, as well as any necessary permissions or procedures for accessing them? Any guidance you can offer would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your assistance in furthering my research.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Alice Yang
