Camp Greenlake  
July 15, 2024  

Dear Mom and Dad,

Greetings from Camp Greenlake! I’m not saying this place has a mosquito problem, but let’s just say I’ve started naming them. So far, my bunkmate and I have survived three days of mystery meat, one epic hike, and one talent show that could’ve used some serious improvement.

We went canoeing yesterday, and I only tipped over twice! I also discovered that the lake is… well, more of a pond. But it’s all good! Next week we’re supposed to go on a “survival skills” campout, so keep your phones on and ready for a possible SOS.

Miss you guys! Send snacks if you can, and tell Muffin the dog I miss her more than camp food!

Love,  
Ben
