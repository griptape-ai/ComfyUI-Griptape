## Render Log Review
It's handy to be able to review render logs and quickly understand your next actions to resolve any errors. In this example, Griptape uses Anthropic Claude Sonnet-3.5 to review an Autodesk Maya render log and return a summary of errors and recommended next actions.

## PDF to Profile Pic
Uses `Griptape Load: Text` node to import a PDF of a robot resume, then the `Griptape Text: Summary` node to generate a summary of the text. Next, a Griptape Agent creates a prompt to generate a profile picture for the robot described in the text. Finally, an image is generated using `Black Forest Labs flux-pro-1.1`.
